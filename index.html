              <li>The searchbar was on the left top part of the screen yet
                the subject only seemed to focus <br> on the right side of the screen
                because that's where the movies and tv show options were.</li>

                clicking through many options <br> such as the change user options and the movies
                option, the subject finally found the search bar.</li>

              <li> Once he returned to the movie page he found the genre pretty quickly.</li>

            <ul>

              <li>He found the tv show heading quickly, but scrolled past the rankings with numbers because he thought they
                were just the cover art of the shows.
